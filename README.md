# GPT Store Mining and Analysis

This repository contains materials from the paper *GPT Store Mining and Analysis*.

## Abstract

As a pivotal extension of the renowned ChatGPT, the GPT Store serves as a dynamic marketplace for a variety of GPTs, shaping the frontier of conversational AI. It offers specialized models tailored to various application scenarios. However, a comprehensive understanding of the entire ecosystem remains lacking at present.
We address this gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of the GPT Store, examining its operational dynamics, security risks, and user engagement patterns. With a dataset containing over 700,000 GPTs, we explore the platform's categories, conversations, ratings, description and files. We also investigate security issues such as data leakage and jailbreak. Additionally, a user study offers insights into the user experience and preferences, providing valuable recommendations to improve the platformâ€™s functionality, security, and user interaction.
Through this analysis, we aim to provide a more complete understanding of the GPT Store ecosystem and propose avenues for its future development.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following sections:

- Data Collection: The methodology used to collect data from the GPT Store.
- Dataset: The dataset used for analysis, including key statistics such as the number of GPTs, creators, and data attributes (e.g., categories, ratings, descriptions).
- Security Risk Analysis: Detailed analysis of the security vulnerabilities within the GPT Store.
- User Study: Summary of the user research conducted through surveys and interviews, highlighting key findings related to user preferences, behaviors, and security concerns.

## Data Collection

In this study, we employed an efficient and reliable method for collecting data from the GPT Store platform.

The OpenAI GPT Store platform provides an API at the endpoint https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/gizmos/search?q=*, where the * can be replaced with a search query string. This API returns detailed information about GPT models, including categories, descriptions, ratings, files, and more. We used a dynamic URL template for data requests, replacing the * in the URL with different search query strings to scrape various resources.

Given the need to collect large volumes of data, we employed a concurrent processing strategy to improve efficiency. In our implementation, we used Python's ThreadPoolExecutor library with a maximum concurrency of 50. This allowed multiple requests to be sent simultaneously, significantly speeding up the data collection process. Requests were processed through the as_completed method, ensuring that each completed request was handled promptly, without waiting for all requests to finish.

You can find the `crawler.py` file in the [Dataset](Dataset) folder. It is our web scraping program, and before using it, please make sure to fill in the header section.

## Dataset

You can find our dataset in the [Dataset/Data](Dataset/Data) folder. Due to repository size limitations, we have only included five example dataset files.

## Security Risk Analysis

Our analysis has revealed several key security vulnerabilities within the GPT Store ecosystem, including:

- Prompt Leakage
- File Leakage
- Jailbreak: 
- Malicious Redirects
- Policy Violations

To assess these risks, we conducted security tests on a subset of GPT models. The prompts used in our tests, as well as the results, can be found in the [Security Risk Analysis/Security Risk](Security%20Risk%20Analysis/Security%20Risk) folder. These tests helped highlight vulnerabilities and provide insights into potential improvements for platform security.

Our analysis identified and classified several types of policy violations within the GPT Store ecosystem. These violations were categorized into six distinct types, each representing a particular area of concern. The categories are as follows:

1. Gambling
2. Adult Content
3. Copyright
4. Politics
5. Drug
6. Offensive Talk

Each violation type is denoted by a unique number, as mentioned above. The detailed results, including the models and their corresponding violations, can be found in the [Security Risk Analysis/Policy Violation](Security%20Risk%20Analysis/Policy%20Violation) folder.

## User Study

In order to gain deeper insights into user interactions with the GPT Store and to understand their preferences, concerns, and experiences, we conducted a comprehensive user study. This included both a quantitative survey and qualitative one-on-one interviews.

You can find our survey and interview results in the [User Study](User%20Study) folder.
